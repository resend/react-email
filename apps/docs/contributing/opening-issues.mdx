Opening issues is a crucial step in open-source, as issues keep projects stable and help maintainers understand the needs of the community.

To help us maintain a stable project, please observe the following guidelines and general rules:

## Open issues for bugs only

We ask that **issues are only opened for bugs**, and not for questions or feature requests. Questions and feature requests should be asked in [Discussions](https://github.com/resend/react-email/discussions).

## Include a proper reproduction

To ensure your issue can be addressed, please **include a proper reproduction**.

Please avoid:
- Setting the link to the reproduction pointing to our repository
- Providing a code snippet that does not sufficiently reproduce the issue

Failing to include a proper reproduction may require extra back-and-forth between you and us, slow the process of fixing the issue for you and others, and make it harder to check if the issue has been fixed on a new release.

## Test the latest versions before opening an issue

Before opening an issue regarding a bug, please test with both:
1. the latest canary version
2. the latest stable version

If the bug is fixed on canary, you can still open an issue, and we will tag it with `Fixed under canary` so others will know it has been fixed.

If you do find that the bug was introduced in a specific version, and an older
version didn't have the issue then you should mention that this is a regression
and in what versions it was introduced.

## Conclusion

Now that you are ready, click below to open an issue! Thank you so much for contributing.
