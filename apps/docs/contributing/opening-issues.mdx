Opening issues is a really important step in the open-source flow, they are truly one of the 
things that keeps a project stable and are also a pointer to the commitment of the maintainers 
of the project.

If you are going to open an issue we would really appreciate that you follow a few guidelines
and general rules so that we can work in a more smooth manner and not waste time.

## Think twice before opening an issue

Before opening an issue, it is going to be very helpful that you first think twice about
what domain it falls under. Many times, issues will get opened asking questions, or  
making feature proposals. Please keep both of these under our 
[Discussions](https://github.com/resend/react-email/discussions)
as this is where we prefer to keep them.

This is important so that **actual bugs are higher priority** than both questions and feature
requests. That is not to say these are not important, as they are important to us, 
both to keep the community alive and to take the project further respectively.

## Make a proper reproduction

In most of the cases, an issue will need a proper reproduction, please provide one. 
Do not set the link to the reproduction pointing to our repository either, unless it is into
one of our examples that does indeed reproduce the issue. Make a reproduction yourself.

Let me walk you through the following situation. Imagine you open up an issue, and you do not
provide a reproduction, if we are to consider your issue and try to reproduce, we will have to
ask questions until we can get something that is the same issue. But oh, it might not be the same
issue either, we might have gotten into a different place from this, not only that but
the asynchronous back-and-forth of these questions adds up quite fast, this results in two things:

1. Your actual issue might not actually get fixed
2. Other people that have the same issue will not get their fix as soon as possible
3. It will be a lot harder to check if the issue has been fixed on a new release

So even though it may feel a bit cumbersome at the moment of opening the issue to make an
actual reproduction, please do so, because it will be much more beneficial for you, 
others library users and the collaborators that will try fixing the issue for you.

## Always test with the latest canary and stable versions

If you are going to open up an issue regarding a bug, it is going to save a lot of time
if you just test both the latest canary and latest stable versions to make sure your issue
already hasn't been fixed on any other version.

If you do find that the bug was introduced in a specific version, and an older version didn't
have the issue it would be extremely helpful if you tell us this bug was introduced as a regression
from that version you saw. This is so that we can then take the necessary measures to avoid
this kind of thing happening in the future to others.
