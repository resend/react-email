Try reading this section if you feel like the amount of directories or files are cumbersome
or if you can't understand what is what.

## Top-level directories

After cloning the [React Email repository](https://github.com/resend/react-email) you will
be able to see a few directories at the root:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Directory</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        [packages](https://github.com/resend/react-email/tree/canary/packages)
      </td>
      <td>
        Contains all the [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) published packages that we currently have, 
        each directory should be one of these, with exception of [a few of them]() 
        that are meant for shared configuration but you shouldn't have to worry about them in
        the vast majority of cases.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        [apps](https://github.com/resend/react-email/tree/canary/apps)
      </td>
      <td>
        Here you can find all of the apps related to our online presence, like: 
        - this documentation (under `apps/docs`), 
        - the demo emails we have on [demo.react.email](https://demo.react.email/preview/vercel-invite-user.tsx) (under `apps/demo`) 
        - and the Next app we have for our landing page on [react.email](https://react.email) (under `apps/web`)
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
