We've created this guide to help new contributors understand and navigate the React Email codebase.

## Top-level directories

After cloning the [React Email repository](https://github.com/resend/react-email) you will see a few root-level directories. Here's a brief overview of each:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Directory</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
[apps](https://github.com/resend/react-email/tree/canary/apps)
      </td>
      <td>
        Here you can find all of the apps related to our online presence, like:
        - this documentation (under [apps/docs](https://github.com/resend/react-email/tree/canary/apps/docs)),
        - the demo emails we have on [demo.react.email](https://demo.react.email/preview/vercel-invite-user.tsx)
          (under [apps/demo](https://github.com/resend/react-email/tree/canary/apps/demo))
        - the Next app we have for our landing page on [react.email](https://react.email) (under [apps/web](https://github.com/resend/react-email/tree/canary/apps/web))
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
[benchmarks](https://github.com/resend/react-email/tree/canary/benchmarks)
      </td>
      <td>
        We make benchmarks from version-to-version to demonstrate data-observable performance gains with metrics like *p99 and p75*.

        For example, see the [Improved Performance for Tailwind Emails](https://resend.com/blog/improved-performance-for-tailwind-emails) benchmark.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        [packages](https://github.com/resend/react-email/tree/canary/packages)
      </td>
      <td>
        Most contributions will be made to the packages in this directory.

        This directory contains all our published [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) packages.
        Each subdirectory is a single component published as its own package, with the exception of a few packages that serve as shared configuration.
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<Note>
  Feel free to [open a discussion](https://github.com/resend/react-email/discussions/new?category=ideas) if you have suggestions on how to better structure these packages to make them more manageable and approachable.
</Note>

## Multiple packages

The react-email repository is a [pnpm monorepo](https://pnpm.io/next/workspaces), which means it contains
multiple packages.

Because we use pnpm, you will need to use [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) to install and run each package. If you do not have pnpm installed, we recommend you install it using [corepack](https://github.com/nodejs/corepack) as follows:

```bash
corepack enable
corepack prepare pnpm@latest --activate
```

Currently we have the following packages:

<div className="grid gap-2" style={{ gridTemplateColumns: '1fr 1fr 1fr' }}>
  <div>
    - [@react-email/body](https://github.com/resend/react-email/tree/canary/packages/body)

  </div>
</div>

Most of the passages are very small and can be easily understood by reading the code, so feel free to explore.

### Turborepo

We encourage using [turborepo](https://turbo.build/repo) to manage the packages.

It's often helpful to [install Turborepo globally](https://turbo.build/repo/docs/installing) to make it easier to run commands in any of the repositories. With a global installation, running `turbo build` in any of the packages will build both the package
you are on as well as the dependent packages. The global installation handles [version mismatching as well](https://turbo.build/repo/docs/installing#install-per-repository).

### The React Email CLI

The CLI (i.e. `packages/react-email`) is key to the best development experience with react.email, but it is complex. Here is a brief overview of the CLI.

The CLI includes two components:
- A Next app for the `email dev` and `email build` commands
- A [commander.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/commander) CLI

In the NextJS app, we quietly include an `src/cli` directory that is not published but is compiled into a root `cli` directory. This structure provides a good developer experience as we can both share certain functions and communicate between the CLI components.

We trigger rebuilds of email templates after they have been saved using the
[chokidar](https://www.npmjs.com/package/chokidar) package
alongside the [socket.io](https://socket.io/) package to detect file changes and send
a message to the server to trigger a rebuild.

## Testing

For testing, we use [vitest](https://vitest.dev/). We prefer to define globals and run tests under the `happy-dom` environment.

We do not strictly enforce testing coverage, but encourage it.

For help testing, see our [Development workflow guide](/contributing/development-workflow/2-running-tests).

<Note>
The `@react-email/render` package's `renderAsync` does a fair bit of magic to simulate `edge` and other environments that are not supported by `happy-dom`. For this use case, we override the [environment on a per-file basis](https://vitest.dev/guide/environment#environments-for-specific-files) for its tests
</Note>

## Linting

We use [biomejs](https://biomejs.dev/) for linting and formatting. Both the linting and formatting are ensured by our GitHub CI so make sure you lint and format your code (`pnpm lint:fix`) before opening a PR or asking for a review on it.

For help linting and formatting, see our [Development workflow guide on linting](/contributing/development-workflow/3-linting).

## Building

We use [tsup](https://github.com/egoist/tsup) to build most packages. (The only exception for this is the `@react-email/tailwind` package which currently uses `vite` due to a few issues with `tsup` and `tailwindcss`'s bundling.) For help building packages, see our [Development workflow guide](/contributing/development-workflow/4-building).

<Note>
Building in each package will run `tsup` with a few settings, typically `src/index.ts --format esm,cjs --dts --external react`.
Tsup handles building both ESM and CJS versions along with the type definitions exported from the entry point, `src/index.ts`, without bundling `react`, which can cause issues.
</Note>

### Why build before publishing?

We build most of the packages before publishing for a few reasons:

1. All the exported types can be imported from the same place the JavaScript is imported
2. We have proper [CommonJS](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/modules.html#modules-commonjs-modules)
and [ES Modules](https://nodejs.org/api/esm.html#modules-ecmascript-modules) support
3. Code that isn't exported is not published or downloaded
