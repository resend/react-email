Try reading this section if you feel like the amount of directories or files are cumbersome
or if you can't understand what is what.

## Top-level directories

After cloning the [React Email repository](https://github.com/resend/react-email) you will
be able to see a few directories at the root:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Directory</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
[apps](https://github.com/resend/react-email/tree/canary/apps)
      </td>
      <td>
        Here you can find all of the apps related to our online presence, like: 
        - this documentation (under [apps/docs](https://github.com/resend/react-email/tree/canary/apps/docs)), 
        - the demo emails we have on [demo.react.email](https://demo.react.email/preview/vercel-invite-user.tsx) 
          (under [apps/demo](https://github.com/resend/react-email/tree/canary/apps/demo)) 
        - the Next app we have for our landing page on [react.email](https://react.email) (under [apps/web](https://github.com/resend/react-email/tree/canary/apps/web))
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        [benchmarks](https://github.com/resend/react-email/tree/canary/benchmarks)
      </td>
      <td>
        These are meant to be benchmarks we make from version-to-version to demonstrate with actual
        data that performance gains are really true with metrics like *p99 and p75*.

        One example of them is the one for the [Improved Performance for Tailwind Emails](https://resend.com/blog/improved-performance-for-tailwind-emails)
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        [packages](https://github.com/resend/react-email/tree/canary/packages)
      </td>
      <td>
        This is probably where you are going to spend the majority of your time if you are going to contribute.
        
        It contains all the [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) published packages that we currently have, 
        each directory should be one of these, with the exception of [a few of them]() 
        that are meant for shared configuration but you shouldn't have to worry about them in
        the vast majority of cases.
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<Note>
  If you have an idea of a better way we could structure these packages so that they could
  be more manageable and approachable we would really appreciate you 
  [create a discussion](https://github.com/resend/react-email/discussions/new?category=ideas) with your thoughts 
  on this.
</Note>

## Multiple packages

This repository is a [pnpm monorepo](https://pnpm.io/next/workspaces) which means it contains
multiple packages that are mantained. We keep each component we make inside of a package for itself.
Currently we have the following packages:
- [@react-email/body](https://github.com/resend/react-email/tree/canary/packages/body)
- [@react-email/button](https://github.com/resend/react-email/tree/canary/packages/button)
- [@react-email/code-block](https://github.com/resend/react-email/tree/canary/packages/code-block)
- [@react-email/code-inline](https://github.com/resend/react-email/tree/canary/packages/code-inline)
- [@react-email/column](https://github.com/resend/react-email/tree/canary/packages/column)
- [@react-email/components](https://github.com/resend/react-email/tree/canary/packages/components)
- [@react-email/container](https://github.com/resend/react-email/tree/canary/packages/container)
- [create-email](https://github.com/resend/react-email/tree/canary/packages/create-email)
  - Used for our [automatic setup](/getting-started/automatic-setup)
- [@react-email/font](https://github.com/resend/react-email/tree/canary/packages/font)
- [@react-email/head](https://github.com/resend/react-email/tree/canary/packages/head)
- [@react-email/heading](https://github.com/resend/react-email/tree/canary/packages/heading)
- [@react-email/hr](https://github.com/resend/react-email/tree/canary/packages/hr)
- [@react-email/html](https://github.com/resend/react-email/tree/canary/packages/html)
- [@react-email/img](https://github.com/resend/react-email/tree/canary/packages/img)
- [@react-email/link](https://github.com/resend/react-email/tree/canary/packages/link)
- [@react-email/markdown](https://github.com/resend/react-email/tree/canary/packages/markdown)
- [@react-email/preview](https://github.com/resend/react-email/tree/canary/packages/preview)
- [react-email](https://github.com/resend/react-email/tree/canary/packages/react-email)
  - The package for our [`email` CLI](/cli)
- [@react-email/render](https://github.com/resend/react-email/tree/canary/packages/render)
- [@react-email/row](https://github.com/resend/react-email/tree/canary/packages/row)
- [@react-email/section](https://github.com/resend/react-email/tree/canary/packages/section)
- [@react-email/tailwind](https://github.com/resend/react-email/tree/canary/packages/tailwind)
- [@react-email/text](https://github.com/resend/react-email/tree/canary/packages/text)

Don't be scared by the amount of packages as most of them are quite small, with [the largest
of them](https://github.com/resend/react-email/tree/canary/packages/tailwind) being only 900 lines of code.

### The package for our CLI

The CLI is one of the most important pieces for the best development we can provide to users,
it can both cause the biggest amount of pain, during development, as well as increase the user's
speed by quite a lot.

The CLI consists in it of itself of a Next app, that we currently publish without building,
and a CLI using [commander.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/commander). The code for the CLI can be found
at <br/>[`packages/react-email/src/cli`](https://github.com/resend/react-email/tree/canary/packages/react-email/src/cli)
and the code for each of its commands can be found under
<br/>[`packages/react-email/src/cli/commands`](https://github.com/resend/react-email/tree/canary/packages/react-email/src/cli/commands)
