For testing we use [vitest](https://vitest.dev/) for its really awesome speed and simplicity,
we prefer it with its globals defined and all the tests are ran under the `happy-dom` environment.

After you have gone through the [setup](/contributing/development-workflow/2-running-tests) you can
just run `pnpm test` inside of any of the packages. This will run the tests only once. We have two scripts defined
on our packages for testing:

- `pnpm test`: Runs all of the tests once, if ran on the root it will run all of the tests using 
[turborepo](/contributing/codebase-overview#turborepo)
- `pnpm test:watch`: Runs all of the tests and watches for changes. Vitest automatically only runs
the tests that are affected by the code you've changed.

We don't have a very strict policy about testing coverage, but we do try to keep things tested to avoid
both regressions and to make sure that the code is working as expected. A good rule of thumb is that
if you need to simulate use cases to just test a specific portion of code, you should probably have that
split into a function.
