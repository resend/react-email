For testing we use [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) for its really awesome speed
and simplicity, we prefer it with its globals defined and all the tests are ran
under the `happy-dom` environment.

After you have gone through the
[setup](/contributing/development-workflow/2-running-tests) you can just run
`pnpm test` inside any package. This will run the tests only once. We have two
scripts defined on our packages for testing:

- `pnpm test`: Runs all the tests once, if ran on the root it will run the
  tests for all packages using
  [turborepo](/contributing/codebase-overview#turborepo)
- `pnpm test:watch`: Runs all the tests and watches for changes. Vitest
  automatically only runs the tests that are affected by the code you've
  changed.

We don't have a very strict policy about testing coverage, but we do try to
keep things tested to both avoid regressions and to make sure that the code is
working as expected. 

A good rule of thumb is that if you need to simulate use
cases to just check whether a specific portion of code works, you should
probably have that split into a function with a matching unit test.
