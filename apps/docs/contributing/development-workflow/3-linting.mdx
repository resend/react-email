We use [biomejs](https://biomejs.dev/) for linting and formatting. Both linting and formatting are ensured by our GitHub CI, so before opening a PR or asking for a review, please lint and format your code.

## Check for linting issues
To check if there are any linting issues, run `pnpm lint` on the root of the workspace.

```bash
pnpm lint
```

To lint or format the entire project, run `pnpm lint:fix` on the root of the workspace.

```bash
pnpm lint:fix
```

Both the linting and formatting are ensured by our GitHub CI so make sure you lint and format your code before opening a PR or asking for a review on it.
