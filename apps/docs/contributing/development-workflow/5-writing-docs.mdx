We use [Mintlify](https://mintlify.com/) for our documentation.

To preview the docs, you must install their CLI globally:

<CodeGroup>

```sh npm
npm install mintlify -g
```

```sh yarn
yarn global add mintlify
```

```sh pnpm
pnpm add mintlify -g
```

```sh bun
bun add mintlify -g
```

</CodeGroup>

Once you install Mintlify, navigate to the `apps/docs` directory and run the following to get a preview of the docs:

```sh apps/docs
mintlify dev
```

Check out [Mintlify's development guide](https://mintlify.com/docs/development)
for a few more interesting development tools.

## Components

Mintlify uses `mdx` to allow us to write docs in a composable ways. Because of
`mdx`, we can build [our own
components](https://mintlify.com/docs/reusable-snippets#reusable-components)
but it's always best to use the components Mintlify already provides us. Before suggesting a new component, check their [full list of components](https://mintlify.com/docs/content/components).
