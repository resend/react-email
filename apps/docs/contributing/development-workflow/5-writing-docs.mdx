We use [Mintlify](https://mintlify.com/) for our documentation.

To preview the docs, you just need to run:

```sh apps/docs
pnpm dev
```

Check out [Mintlify's development guide](https://mintlify.com/docs/development)
for a few more interesting development tools.

## Components

Mintlify uses `mdx` to allow us to write docs in a composable ways. Because of
`mdx`, we can build [our own
components](https://mintlify.com/docs/reusable-snippets#reusable-components)
but it's always best to use the components Mintlify already provides us. Before writing down a new component, check their [full list of components](https://mintlify.com/docs/content/components).
