Before you can start actually developing you will have to understand
a few things and get things setup so that you can get to what you need to do.

First things first, make sure you are using the same Node version as we are, at least **Node 18**. 

Then, after you do have the right Node version, let's go over the setup for development.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Clone the repository">
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/resend/react-email
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title={<>Enable <a href="https://pnpm.io/">pnpm</a> through <a href="https://github.com/nodejs/corepack">corepack</a></>}>
    ```bash inside of react-email
    corepack enable
    corepack prepare pnpm@latest --activate
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Install all the dependencies">
    ```bash inside of react-email
    pnpm install
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Build all the packages">
    ```bash inside of react-email
    pnpm build
    ```

    It's important to run this because each package may depend on other packages,
    so having them pre-built may save you a bit of headache.
  </Step>
</Steps>

This should have you set up and running without any issues, If you do have any issues
please [open up an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/resend/react-email/issues/new?assignees=&labels=Type%3A+Bug&projects=&template=1.bug_report.yml).
