Before you can start developing, you will need to get the project setup.

<Info>
To contribute to the project, you must use **Node 18** or higher.
</Info>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Clone the repository">
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/resend/react-email
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title={<>Enable <a href="https://pnpm.io/">pnpm</a> through <a href="https://github.com/nodejs/corepack">corepack</a></>}>
    ```bash inside of react-email
    corepack enable
    corepack prepare pnpm@latest --activate
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Install all the dependencies">
    ```bash inside of react-email
    pnpm install
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Build all the packages">
    ```bash inside of react-email
    pnpm build
    ```

    <Note>
    Building first is crucial because each package may depend on other packages, and pre-building them will ensure that you don't run into issues when developing.
