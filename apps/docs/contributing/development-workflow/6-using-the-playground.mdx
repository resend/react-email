When making changes to the components, there can be a lot of added friction because of having to rebuild each component every time you want to see the results of your changes at runtime. For that reason we have a [playground](https://github.com/resend/react-email/tree/canary/playground).

## 1. Create an email template

Create a new file at `playground/emails/testing.tsx` 

```tsx emails/testing.tsx
import { Html, Head, Body, Tailwind, Text } from '@react-email/components';

export default function Testing() {
  return <Tailwind>
    <Html>
      <Head/>

      <Body className="bg-black text-white">
        <Text className="m-0 my-4 bg-cyan-200 text-slate-800">
          This is a testing email template.
        </Text>
      </Body>
    </Html>
  </Tailwind>;
}
```

<Tip>
You can use [playground/emails](https://github.com/resend/react-email/tree/canary/playground/emails) as a canvas for you to experiment with component changes, or various user use cases, and git will ignore all email templates there.

## 2. Run playground server

```sh
pnpm dev
```

## 3. Open in your browser

Go to http://localhost:3000
