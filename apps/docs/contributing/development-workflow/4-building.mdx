description: "How we build each package before publishing"
---

What we currently use, for the most part, is the awesome [tsup](https://github.com/egoist/tsup).
The only exception for this is the `@react-email/tailwind` package which currently uses `vite`
due to a few issues with `tsup` and `tailwindcss`'s bundling.
If you want to build a package you can just run:

```bash package/* (ex: package/render)
pnpm build
```

This will literally run `tsup` with a few settings we have for it. Generally they are just<br/>
`src/index.ts --format esm,cjs --dts --external react` which generates both an ESM and CJS versions of the package
and the type definitions that were exported from `src/index.ts`, which is the entry point.
`--external react` here ensures that `react` is not bundled in which can cause many issues.

### Why build before publishing?

Currently, we do building for most of the packages. This is important for a few key reasons
that improve the usability of each package:

1. All the exported types can be imported from the same place the JavaScript is imported
2. We have proper [CommonJS](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/modules.html#modules-commonjs-modules)
   and [ES Modules](https://nodejs.org/api/esm.html#modules-ecmascript-modules) support
3. Code that isn't exported is not published nor downloaded
4. We use TypeScript and `tsc` is not a good option to compile the code for various reasons
