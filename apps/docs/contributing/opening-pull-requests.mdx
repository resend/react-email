First and foremost, thank you so much for considering opening a pull requests to the project,
without you and your contributions React Email would not be possible.

Secondly, we recommend you first take a look into our [Development workflow](/contributing/development-workflow/1-setup) 
before getting into the pull request, it will get you up and started understanding a few basics to get things done
well.

## A note on feature development

If you want to add a feature, it is really important that we first discuss in what direction
this feature should be taken, or it should be implemented at all. For this, please open up 
[a discussion](https://github.com/resend/react-email/discussions/new?category=ideas) 
as an [RFC](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Request_for_Comments) mentioning you intend in working on this.

Once we have come to terms in how this should be implemented and the details for it, you can get down to business.

## A note on fixing issues

If you've found a problem, and you intend in fixing it through a PR, please open up 
[a proper issue](https://github.com/resend/react-email/issues/new?assignees=&labels=Type%3A+Bug&projects=&template=1.bug_report.yml)
as it can be helpful if your fix isn't good enough or if you aren't able to finish.
This also helps track the work and helps others find the issue and workarounds if there are any.

One extra thing that would make it really high chance that we merge your PR, is if you add tests
along with your pull request that ensures that, in later versions of the same code, regressions aren't
introduced.

## Creating the pull request

So that things go as smoothly as possible, create your pull request through the following steps:

1. Create [a fork](https://github.com/resend/react-email/fork) of the repo
2. Create a new branch based on `canary` that represents what you are doing
3. Make your changes and commit them to this new branch
4. Create pull request from your fork into React Email's `canary` branch

## Writing a good description

Once you open your pull request, we will need to review it. This means we need to understand
what you wanted to add or fix so that we can read your code in a way that we can understand it
much more easily. It's much easier to understand code once you expect for it to do something
than reading it to *then understand* what it does.

Currently, we do not have a pull request template you can follow to help you,
but you can follow some common guidelines.

### 1. Describe your intent

Every change has an intent. Bug fix pull requests intend in resolving an issue so that
it, either unblocks you, or unblocks someone else. Feature pull requests intend in adding
something new that improves the experience, either for you, or for someone else.

The intent is really helpful because it doesn't just make the process of reading your code
faster, but also because it allows us to reason about your code and think of probable
better ways of writing what you've written.

The more straightforward the intent is, the better.

### 2. Write down what technical difficulties you went through

The person reading your pull request is not going to be someone that goes through your
pull request only on the surface. They are going to read the code, and try to understand
as much as they can. That means that, if you describe what technical difficulties you went through
as much as possible, it may allow us to discuss of a better solution, or it even may allow
for future contributors to find and fix an issue.

The more you document of your process, the better.

### 3. Write down the specific changes the pull request introduces

This is also another step that is going to be helpful in making your pull request more reviewable.
Writing down the changes, technically and, generally specifically, is going to go a long way
in helping us understand what the code does. This is something similar to the intent, as it describes
what you've done, but it is going to serve as a bit of reference if someone can't quite understand
what you did in a piece of code.

## Getting in touch with us

It might be helpful to directly talk with us to discuss merging the PR or even
talking any RFC. You can find us and talk with us on [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/n2pWEjjNnD),
there you can also ask questions and help out others.
