First and foremost, thank you so much for considering opening a pull requests to the project,
without you and your contributions React Email would not be possible.

Secondly, we recommend you first take a look into our [Development workflow](/contributing/development-workflow/1-setup) 
before getting into the pull request, it will get you up and started understanding a few basics to get things done
well.

## A note on feature development

If you want to add a feature, it is really important that we first discuss in what direction
this feature should be taken or it should be implemented at all. For this, please open up 
[a discussion](https://github.com/resend/react-email/discussions/new?category=ideas) 
as an [RFC](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Request_for_Comments) mentioning you intend in working on this.

Once we have come to terms in how this should be implemented and the details for it you can get down to business.

## A note on fixing issues

If you've found an issue and you intend in fixing it through a PR, please open up 
[a proper issue](https://github.com/resend/react-email/issues/new?assignees=&labels=Type%3A+Bug&projects=&template=1.bug_report.yml)
as it can be helpful if your fix isn't good enough or if you aren't able to finish.
This also helps track the work and helps others find the issue and workarounds if there are any.

One extra thing that would make it really high chance that we merge your PR, is if you add tests
along with your pull request that ensures that in later versions of the same code regressions aren't
introduced.

## Creating the pull request

So that things go as smoothly as possible, create your pull request through the following steps:

1. Create [a fork](https://github.com/resend/react-email/fork) of the repo
2. Create a new branch based on `canary` that represents what you are doing
3. Make your changes and commit them to this new branch
4. Create pull request from your fork into React Email's `canary` branch

## Getting in touch with us

It might be helpful to directly talk with us to discuss merging the PR or even
talking any RFC. You can find us and talk with us on [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/n2pWEjjNnD),
there you can also ask questions and help out others.
