## From MJML

1. Remove the `mjml` npm package and install `react-email` and `@react-email/components`
2. Find all MJML templates ending with the `.mjml` extension and convert these to React components with the `.tsx` or `.jsx` extension.
3. Replace MJML standard component tags with React Email component tags where possible, including `<Text>`, `<Img>`, `<Button>` etc.
4. Convert custom MJML components with the `.js` extension to React components with the `.tsx` or `.jsx` extension.
