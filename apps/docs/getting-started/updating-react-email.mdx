## Update from React Email 4.0 to 5.0

1. Update your React Email packages: `npm install @react-email/components@latest react-email@latest`.
2. Replace all `renderAsync` uses with `render`.

Make sure you update `@react-email/components` alongside `react-email`. The compatibility checker now only supports Tailwind v4, so you need to update both in sync.
