## Update from React Email 4.0 to 5.0

1. Update your React Email packages: `npm install @react-email/components@latest react-email@latest`.
2. Replace all `renderAsync` uses with `render`.

Make sure you update `@react-email/components` alongside `react-email`. The compatibility checker now only supports Tailwind 4, so you need to update both in sync.

### Tailwind 4

This update includes Tailwind 4 via `@react-email/components@latest`. Some utilities have changed since Tailwind 3—review their [upgrade guide](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/upgrade-guide#changes-from-v3) to adjust your code if needed.

Tailwind 4 also changes how classes are handled in components. Previously, passing `className` added an equivalent inlined `style` prop, which caused confusion and performance issues. Now, styles are only inlined on elements, not components. If you were merging utilities with the `style` prop, consider using [tailwind-merge](https://github.com/dcastil/tailwind-merge) instead.

The configuration remains in the `config` prop.
