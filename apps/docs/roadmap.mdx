If any of these are important to you please let us know. We use community feedback to plan our roadmap, and we also encourage contributors to submit their ideas on [Github Discussions](https://github.com/resend/react-email/discussions) so that we can discuss them with the community.

Feel free to contribute to any of them as well.

## Planned Features
