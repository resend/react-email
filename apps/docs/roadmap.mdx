If any of these are important to you please let us know. We use community feedback to plan our roadmap, and we also encourage contributors to submit their ideas on [Discord](https://react.email/discord) so that we can discuss them with the community.

Feel free to contribute to any of them as well.

## Planned Features

These are the features that we've planned to work on in the near future.

### MDX components

Enable users to create entire emails using MDX only.

- [GitHub Issue #27](https://github.com/resendlabs/react-email/issues/27)

### VS Code extension

Build a VS Code extension where developers can build the email using React on one side and see a live preview right next to it.

- [GitHub Issue #15](https://github.com/resendlabs/react-email/issues/15)
