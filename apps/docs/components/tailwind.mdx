const Email = () => {
  return (
    <Tailwind
      config={{
        theme: {
          extend: {
            colors: {
              brand: "#007291",
            },
          },
        },
      }}

<Info>
    Most email clients are style-limited and some styles may not work.
    
    One example of this is how Tailwind uses `rem` as its main unit for 
    better accessibility. This is not supported by [some email
    clients](https://www.caniemail.com/features/css-unit-rem/), if you want you
    can override the Tailwind config.

    We can't really apply this configuration for you as it would have a few
    drawbacks. In the future, we will probably provide a preset to remediate this.
    But, for now, here's a good starter configuration you can use to avoid these issues:

## Known limitations

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="No support for contexts inside the component">
    Currently adding a context's provider inside of the Tailwind component, won't allow you 
to properly call the `useContext` in any of the children of it, due to some technical limitations
regarding on how we currently map the classNames into styles. 

The current workaround for this right now is to move the context's provider higher than the Tailwind
component, so that all children inside Tailwind can properly call `useContext` with the context.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="No support for prose from @tailwindcss/typography">
    We do not yet support `prose`, and beyond that, we don't yet support classes that might
be resolved into selectors that are relatively complex. That is, selectors with more
than a class lookup.

This is because we optimistically look into the selectors for class names
and look these up later on the elements, and since `prose`, by using more complicated selectors, 
cannot be directly inlined without matching the selectors to the elements, it isn't able to
match the selectors appropriately.

This also means some other utilities do not work either, like the [`space-*` utility](https://v3.tailwindcss.com/docs/space).

The only exception for this inlining of styles is with media queries, as they are not inlinable. We do not
do the same for `hover:` styles though, but since [their support is not best](https://www.caniemail.com/features/css-pseudo-class-hover/), you probably won't need it.

In the future, we will be inlining all the styles we can by actually matching the 
selectors *against the elements* themselves.
