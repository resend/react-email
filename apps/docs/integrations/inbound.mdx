## 1. Install dependencies

Get the [@react-email/components](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@react-email/components) package and the [Inbound Node.js SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inboundemail).

Make sure you have an account on [inbound](https://inbound.new), you will need an inbound API key.

<CodeGroup>

```sh npm
npm install inboundemail @react-email/components
```

```sh yarn
yarn add inboundemail @react-email/components
```

```sh pnpm
pnpm add inboundemail @react-email/components
```

```sh bun
bun add inboundemail @react-email/components
```

</CodeGroup>

## 2. Create an email using React

Start by building your email template in a `.jsx` or `.tsx` file.

```tsx email.tsx
import * as React from 'react';
import { Html, Button } from "@react-email/components";

export function Email(props) {
  const { url } = props;

  return (
    <Html lang="en">
      <Button href={url}>Click me</Button>
    </Html>
  );
}

export default Email;
```

## 3. Send email

<Info>When integrating with other services, you need to convert your React template into HTML before sending. Inbound takes care of that for you. You can just directly pass the React template to the SDK.</Info>

Import the email template you just built and use the Inbound SDK to send it.

```tsx
import { Inbound } from 'inboundemail';
import { Email } from './email';

const inbound = new Inbound(process.env.INBOUND_API_KEY);

await inbound.emails.send({
  from: 'you@example.com',
  to: 'user@gmail.com',
  subject: 'hello world',
  react: <Email url="https://example.com" />,
});
```

## 4. Reply to an email

Use the Inbound SDK to reply to an email with the same template you just created.

```tsx
import { Inbound } from 'inboundemail';
import { Email } from './email';

const inbound = new Inbound(process.env.INBOUND_API_KEY);

await inbound.emails.reply(email.id,{
  react: <Email url="https://example.com" />,
});
```
