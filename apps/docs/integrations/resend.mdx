<Tip>Resend was built by the same team that created React Email, which makes this our recommendation to send emails.</Tip>

## 1. Install dependencies

Get the [@react-email/components](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@react-email/components) package and the [Resend Node.js SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/resend).

<CodeGroup>

```sh npm
npm install resend @react-email/components
```

```sh yarn
yarn add resend @react-email/components
```

```sh pnpm
pnpm add resend @react-email/components
```

</CodeGroup>

## 2. Create an email using React

Start by building your email template in a `.jsx` or `.tsx` file.

```tsx email.tsx
import * as React from 'react';
import { Html, Button } from "@react-email/components";

export function Email(props) {
  const { url } = props;

  return (
    <Html lang="en">
      <Button href={url}>Click me</Button>
    </Html>
  );
}

export default Email;
```

## 3. Send email

<Info>When integrating with other services, you need to convert your React template into HTML before sending. Resend takes care of that for you.</Info>

Import the email template you just built and use the Resend SDK to send it.

```tsx
import { Resend } from 'resend';
import { Email } from './email';

const resend = new Resend('re_123456789');

await resend.emails.send({
  from: 'you@example.com',
  to: 'user@gmail.com',
  subject: 'hello world',
  react: Email({ url: "https://example.com" }),
});
```
