## 1. Install dependencies

Get the [@react-email/components](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@react-email/components) package and the [IndiePitcher Node.js SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/indiepitcher).

<CodeGroup>

```sh npm
npm install indiepitcher @react-email/components
```

```sh yarn
yarn add indiepitcher @react-email/components
```

```sh pnpm
pnpm add indiepitcher @react-email/components
```

</CodeGroup>

## 2. Create an email using React

Start by building your email template in a `.jsx` or `.tsx` file.

```tsx email.tsx
import * as React from "react";
import { Html, Button } from "@react-email/components";

export function Email(props) {
  const { url } = props;

  return (
    <Html lang="en">
      <Button href={url}>Click me</Button>
    </Html>
  );
}

export default Email;
```

## 3. Convert to HTML and send email

Import the email template you just built, convert into an HTML string, and use the IndiePitcher SDK to send it.

```tsx
import { IndiePitcher } from 'indiepitcher';
import { render } from "@react-email/components";
import { Email } from "./email";

const indiePitcher = new IndiePitcher(process.env.INDIEPITCHER_API_KEY || '');

const emailHtml = await render(<Email url="https://example.com" />);

await indiePitcher.sendEmail({
  to: 'petr@indiepitcher.com',
  subject: 'Hello world',
  body: emailHtml,
  bodyFormat: 'html',
});
```
