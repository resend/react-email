## Install

Install the component from your command line.

<CodeGroup>

```sh npm
npm install @react-email/code-block -E
```

```sh yarn
yarn add @react-email/code-block -E
```

```sh pnpm
pnpm add @react-email/code-block -E
```

</CodeGroup>

## Getting Started

Add the component into your email component as follows.

```jsx
import { CodeBlock, dracula } from '@react-email/code-block';

const Email = () => {
  const code = `export default async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const html = await renderAsync(
      EmailTemplate({ firstName: 'John' })
    );
    return NextResponse.json({ html });
  } catch (error) {
    return NextResponse.json({ error });
  }
}`;

  return (<CodeBlock
    code={code}
    lineNumbers // add this so that there are line numbers beside each code line
    theme={dracula}
    language="javascript"
  />);
};
```

This should render a code-block with the desired theme.

## Theming

Themes for this component are basically a set of styles for each kind of token that can result from prismjs's tokenization. See [here](https://prismjs.com/tokens.html) for more information on the tokens available.

An example of a theme would be this:

```json
{
  "base": {
    "color": "#f8f8f2",
    "background": "#282a36",
    "textShadow": "0 1px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3)",
    "fontFamily": "Consolas, Monaco, 'Andale Mono', 'Ubuntu Mono', monospace",
    "textAlign": "left",
    "whiteSpace": "pre",
    "wordSpacing": "normal",
    "wordBreak": "normal",
    "wordWrap": "normal",
    "lineHeight": "1.5",
    "MozTabSize": "4",
    "OTabSize": "4",
    "tabSize": "4",
    "WebkitHyphens": "none",
    "MozHyphens": "none",
    "MsHyphens": "none",
    "hyphens": "none",
    "padding": "1em",
    "margin": ".5em 0",
    "overflow": "auto",
    "borderRadius": "0.3em"
  },
  "comment": {
    "color": "#6272a4"
  },
  "prolog": {
    "color": "#6272a4"
  },
  "doctype": {
    "color": "#6272a4"
  },
  "cdata": {
    "color": "#6272a4"
  },
  "punctuation": {
    "color": "#f8f8f2"
  },
  "property": {
    "color": "#ff79c6"
  },
  // ...
}
```

Each token type can have their own defined styles and for each one of there can be any styles that can be applied directly to `React` elements. 
As you can see from the example `dracula` theme though, there is a defined property called `base` which is the styling for the `pre` element that wraps the HTML being rendered.

For you to not need to defined a theme without any basis, or to not define one that already has been defined, we have many default themes exported from `@react-email/code-block`. 
These themes were generated by a bit of code that converts a CSS file for a prismjs theme into a object theme of these. 
If you want to generate a theme from another existing prismjs theme you can do so by looking into [this](https://github.com/gabrielmfern/from-prismjs-to-react-email-code-block-theme).
